Peek at the process
    Use the ps:
        (1). By default, the ps command shows only thre process that belong to the current user and that are running on the current terminal.
    The GNU ps command that's used in Linux systems support three different types of command line parameters:
        (1). Unix-style parameters, which are preceded by a dash.
            -A      Shows all processes
            -N      Show the opposite of the specified parameters
            -a      Shows all processes except session headers and processes without terminal
            -d      Show all processes except session headers.
            -e      Show all the processes
            -C cmslist      Shows processes with a group ID listed in cmdlist
            -G grplist      Shows processes with a group ID listed in grplist.
            -U userlist     Shows processes owned by a userid listed in userlist
            -g grplist      Shows processes by session or by groupid contained in grplist
            -p pidlis       Shows processes with PIDs in the list pidlist.
            -s sesslist     Shows processes with session ID in the list pidlist
            -t ttylist      Shows processes with terminal ID in the list ttylist
            -u userlist     Shows processes by effective userid in the list userlist
            -F              Uses extra full output
            -O format       Displays specific columns in the list format, along with the default columns
            -M      Display security information about the process
            -c      Shows additional scheduler information about the process
            -f      Display a full format string
            -j      Show job information
            -l      Display a long string listing
            -o fprmat       Display only the specific columns listed format.
            -y      Prevents display of process flags
            -Z      Display the security context information.
            -H      Display processes in a hierarchical format(Showing parent processes)
            -n name list    Defines the values to display in the WCHAN column
            -w      Use wide ouput format, for unlimited width displays
            -L      Shows process threads
            -V      Display the version of ps

        (2). BSD-style parameters, which are not preceded by a dash
        (3). GNU long parameters, which are preceded by a double dash.
2. Some useful ps option:
    -ef parameter combination --> To view everything runs in the system
    -e  To show all the process running on the system
    -f  To expands the output to show a few useful columns of information.
  UID   User responsible for launching the process
  PID   The process ID of the process
  PPID  The PID of the parent process
  C:    Processor utilization over the lifetime of the process
  STIME:    The system time when the process started
  TTY   The ternimal device from which the process was launched.
  TIME  The cumulative CPU time required to run the process
  CMD   The name of the program that was started.

  Additional information about the process--> use the -l
    (1). F  System flag assigned to the process by the kernel
    (2). S: The state of the process(O=running on processor; S=sleeping; R=runnable, waiting to run, 
            Z=Zombie, process terminated but parent not available; T=process stopped)
    (3). PRI: The priority of the process(Higher numbers means lower priority)
    (4). NI: The nice value, which is used for determined priority
    (5). ADDR: The memory address of the process
    (6). SZ: Approximate amount of swap space required if the process was swapped out
    (7). WCHAN: Address of the kernel function where the process is sleeping.
